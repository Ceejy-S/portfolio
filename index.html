      <h2>Creation</h2>
      <p>
        Creation In December 1891, James Naismith, a Canadian-American professor
        of physical education and instructor at the International Young Men's
        Christian Association Training School (now Springfield College) in
        <strong>Springfield, Massachusetts</strong>,[5] was trying to keep his
        gym class active on a <em>rainy day</em>.[6] He sought a vigorous indoor
        game to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness
        during the long New England winters. After rejecting other ideas as
        either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in gymnasiums, he invented a
        new game in which players would pass a ball to teammates and try to
        score points by tossing the ball into a basket mounted on a wall.
        Naismith wrote the basic rules and nailed a peach basket onto an
        elevated track. Naismith initially set up the peach basket with its
        bottom intact, which meant that the ball had to be retrieved manually
        after each "basket"three pointer or point scored. This quickly proved tedious, so
        Naismith removed the bottom of the basket to allow the balls to be poked
        out with a long dowel after each scored basket. Basketball was
        originally played with a soccer ball. These round balls from
        "association football" were made, at the time, with a set of laces to
        close off the hole needed for inserting the inflatable bladder after the
        other sewn-together segments of the ball's cover had been flipped
        outside-in.[7][8] These laces could cause bounce passes and dribbling to
        be unpredictable.[9] Eventually a lace-free ball construction method was
        invented, and this change to the game was endorsed by Naismith (whereas
        in American football, the lace construction proved to be advantageous
        for gripping and remains to this day).

<p>First Ball</p>
      The first balls made specifically for basketball were brown, and it was
      only in the late 1950s that Tony Hinkle, searching for a ball that would
      be more visible to players and spectators alike, introduced the orange
      ball that is now in common use. Dribbling was not part of the original
      game except for the "bounce pass" to teammates. Passing the ball was the
      primary means of ball movement. Dribbling was eventually introduced but
      limited by the asymmetric shape of early balls.[dubious – discuss]
      Dribbling was common by 1896, with a rule against the double dribble by
      1898.[10] The peach baskets were used until 1906 when they were finally
      replaced by metal hoops with backboards. A further change was soon made,
      so the ball merely passed through. Whenever a person got the ball in the
      basket, his team would gain a point. Whichever team got the most points
      won the game.[11] The baskets were originally nailed to the mezzanine
      balcony of the playing court, but this proved impractical when spectators
      in the balcony began to interfere with shots. The backboard was introduced
      to prevent this interference; it had the additional effect of allowing
      rebound shots.[12] Naismith's handwritten diaries, discovered by his
      granddaughter in early 2006, indicate that he was nervous about the new
      game he had invented, which incorporated rules from a children's game
      called duck on a rock, as many had failed before it.[13] Frank Mahan, one
      of the players from the original first game, approached Naismith after the
      Christmas break, in early 1892, asking him what he intended to call his
      new game. Naismith replied that he hadn't thought of it because he had
      been focused on just getting the game started. Mahan suggested that it be
      called "Naismith ball", at which he laughed, saying that a name like that
      would kill any game. Mahan then said, "Why not call it basketball?"
      Naismith replied, "We have a basket and a ball, and it seems to me that
      would be a good name for it."[14][15] The first official game was played
      in the YMCA gymnasium in Albany, New York, on January 20, 1892, with nine
      players. The game ended at 1–0; the shot was made from 25 feet (7.6 m), on
      a court just half the size of a present-day Streetball or National
      Basketball Association (NBA) court. At the time, soccer was being played
      with 10 to a team (which was increased to 11). When winter weather got too
      icy to play soccer, teams were taken indoors, and it was convenient to
      have them split in half and play basketball with five on each side. By
      1897–98, teams of five became standard.
